    Define your anchor points.
    You mentioned wanting four anchor points: a hot one at the south of the map, a cold one at the north, and two with random temperature values at the east and west. You'll need to define the coordinates of these points, as well as their assigned temperature values.

    Generate your baseline Perlin Noise map.
    This is the "temperatureGenerator.noise()" call you're currently making. This noise will form the baseline temperature map before biasing.

    Calculate distances to anchor points.
    For each pixel in your map, calculate its distance to each of the anchor points. You'll likely want to normalize these distances so they fall within a standard range, perhaps between 0 (for a pixel at the anchor point) and 1 (for a pixel at the furthest possible distance from the anchor point).

    Calculate weights based on distances.
    For each pixel, calculate a weight for each anchor point based on its distance to that point. One simple way to do this could be to use the inverse of the distance, so a closer anchor point has a higher weight. To prevent division by zero, you might use something like weight = 1 / (distance + 0.001).

    Calculate bias value.
    Now you'll calculate a bias value for each pixel. This could be as simple as multiplying the weight of each anchor point by its assigned temperature value, then summing these results.

    Combine the baseline noise and bias values.
    Finally, you'll calculate the final temperature value for each pixel by combining the baseline noise value and the bias value. You'll likely want to experiment with how much weight to give to each. For example, you might start with finalTemperature = baselineNoise * 0.5 + biasValue * 0.5 and adjust from there.

    Adjust the temperature value for visualization.
    You already have code to visualize the temperature value as a color. You'll need to adjust this to work with the final temperature values.
