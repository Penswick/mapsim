# mapsim

The end goal of this project is to build a fantasy map generator using Vanilla Javascript and HTML Canvas. Utilising the Perlin Noise algorithm.

The development will be split into 2 main chunks. One focused on the primary features that would be expected in any map gen. And then Secondary features, which will add more advanced options.

Primary features:
    Terrain Generation
    Elevation
    Sea level
    Biomes

Secondary features:
    Races and factions
    Borders
    Settlements
    Advanced generation options (number of factions of x race, prevelance of x biome, etc)
